## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which means it is used to predict the probability of an event occurring or not. It is a type of generalized linear model that is used when the dependent variable is binary or categorical.

In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary (i.e., it can take on one of two values, usually 0 or 1), and the independent variables can be either continuous or categorical. The goal of logistic regression is to find the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable by estimating the probability of the dependent variable being 1 given the values of the independent variables.

The logistic regression model uses a logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to map the input values of the independent variables to a value between 0 and 1, which represents the probability of the dependent variable being 1. The logistic function is defined as:

css Copy code p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where p is the predicted probability of the dependent variable being 1, e is the base of the natural logarithm, and z is the linear combination of the independent variables.

The logistic regression model estimates the values of the coefficients of the independent variables that maximize the likelihood of observing the data given the model. This is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation or gradient descent optimization.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data by inputting the values of the independent variables into the logistic function and obtaining the predicted probability of the dependent variable being 1. The model can then classify the new observation as 1 or 0 based on a threshold probability value that is chosen by the user.
